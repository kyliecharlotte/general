        <p class="p">I am a current third year student at the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon. Formally from Beaverton, Oregon outside of Portland.
          <br><br>I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics. I plan to apply for graduate programs in Fall 2024.
          <br><br>Current Courses: 
          <br>
          - Math 281 (Multivariable Calculus II)
          <br>
          - CS 451 (Database Processing)
          <br>
          - CS 313 (Intermediate Data Structures)
          <br><br>
          I have been employed as a paper marker for the Mathematics department at UO since March 2023. I am currently a paper marker for Math 343 (Statistics).
          <br><br>
          In my free time, I enjoy drawing, indoor and outdoor bouldering, and playing video games.

            This list contains links to projects that I have developed both alone and with a larger group.
            <ol>
              <li><i>easyA</i> - Group project for CS 422 (Software Methodologies) at the University of Oregon. 
              <br><br> easyA was designed to let students visualize the grade distribution for different classes across the UO.
              I built the web scraper and administrative tools responsible for updating the data used.  
              <br>

              </li>
              <br>
              <li><i>Dollarless Dining</i> - Group project for CS 422 (Software Methodologies) at the University of Oregon.
              <br><br>Dollarless Dining is a visualization and information tool for students at the UO to view upcoming 
              free food resources and where they are found. I came up with the concept, built the web scraper, and developed
               admin tools for the updating of the food information. <br>

              </li>
              <br>
              <li> <i>Entertain Eugene</i> - Solo Project for CS 407 (Career Internships Seminar) at the University of Oregon.
              <br><br> Entertain Eugene allows users to either enter an artist's name, select a venue, or select a date range, 
              to view upcoming events in Eugene relating to their choice. This was a personal project I created to work with 
              GUIs and web scraping.

            In June of 2024, I will be attending an 8-week summer research program (REU) at Georgetown University in Washington, DC.

            </figure>
            This REU will utilize incoming misinformation detection techniques to analyze multiple information hubs (surveys, social media,
            newspaper articles) leading up to the 2024 election. I will be working under Dr. Lisa Singh, who is a Professor of Computer Science
            at Georgetown who specializes in data-centric computing. Additionally, the program features more Georgetown CS faculty members 
            as mentors, including Dr. Sarah Bargal and Dr. Micah Sherr. 
            <br><br>
            I am excited for this opportunity to colloborate with fellow cohort members and faculty, as well as tackling such an 
            interesting and large (in scope) project.
